Homo sapiens who likes technology.

Always putting energy to learn more about software development; lifelong learner; trying day-by-day to be a better human; sharpening my soft skills and building strong relationships with all around me.

I faithfully believe that education, cooperation and technology can help humankind reach its highest achievements.

If you are an aspiring or junior developer looking for a mentor, reach me! I will be glad and happy to help you through the journey.
