A homo sapiens who likes technology.

Always putting energy to learn more about software development; lifelong learner; trying day-by-day to be a better human; sharpening my soft skills and building strong relationships with all around me.

I faithfully believe that education, cooperation and technology can help humanity reach its highest achievements.

Are you an aspiring/junior developer looking for a mentor? Reach me, I will be glad and happy to help you.

Surf lover! :surfer:
